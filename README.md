# PassGen
A simple password generator that supports all ASCII characters and any length of password.

# Instructions
1. Type in the name of the service you want to generate a password for (this is purely for ease-of-use purposes)
2. Type in the email associated with this service (again, this is purely for ease-of-use purposes, check the output.txt after to see)
3. Type in the length of the desired password (this is included because many login portals have hard length limits and often vary).
